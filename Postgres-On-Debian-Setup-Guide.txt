Guide for os debian 9 / postgres 9.6

* make sure you have a vps for debian 9 stretch ready
* make sure ssh is installed

* log into the postgres user by running "su - postgres"
* user command "createuser NAMEHERE" to make a user

	- you will also need to update postgres config file to allow remote connections to do so:
		1. find the file by running "find / -name "postgresql.conf""
		2. open it with vi by running "vi /etc/postgresql/9.6/main/postgresql.conf" <--- the path you got in step 1
		3. scroll down to "listen_addresses = 'localhost'" and change it to "listen_addresses = '*'" (use delete to delete (comment # may need deleted too) then press INSERT on keyboard for insert mode. To exit press ESC to go back to command mode and then type :w to save as is, then :q + enter to exit)
		4. restart postgres (first run "pg_lsclusters" from root, then run "pg_ctlcluster CLUSTER_VERSION_HERE CLUSTER_NAME_HERE restart"
		5. find pg_hba.conf - "find / -name "pg_hba.conf""
		6. add line "host  all  all 0.0.0.0/0 md5" to file using "vi /etc/postgresql/9.6/main/pg_hba.conf", save and quit vi
